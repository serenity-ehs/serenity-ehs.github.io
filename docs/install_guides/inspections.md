#Summary
Serenity's Inspections, Audit, and Site Walk Through application provides an Inspection Management and Operational Audit solution powered by the ServiceNow platform. It is available for desktop and mobile, including offline support. Our application can stand on its own, but is designed to work with our other products, leverages data you already have in the platform, and can easily integrate with other processes, such as GRC, ITSM, and HRSD.

With this application, you can:

- Create Inspections for Establishments and Equipment
- Complete Inspections across the Organization
- Track Inspection Progress
- Manage Organizational Data
