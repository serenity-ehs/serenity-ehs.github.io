# Summary
Serenity's Health and Safety application provides an Environmental, Health, & Safety solution powered by the ServiceNow platform. Our application can stand on its own but can easily leverage data you already have in the platform as well as integrate with other processes, such as GRC, ITSM, and HRSD.

## With this application, you can:

- Record EHS incidents and near hits, manage releases of material, and identify hazards across sites
- Manage Investigations into the Root Cause of EHS issues
- Execute Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) to contain non-conformances and defects then design and implement solutions to correct the problem
- Risk Assessment
- Track Training Plans to ensure employees have completed all required training to safely perform their job duties
- Report on data and analyze trends across your organization to improve performance
- Meet and automate compliance around regulations and standards, such as OSHA 300, 300A, and 301 requirements
- Configure Serenity EHS to meet your specific requirements without complex development and expensive resources

"An effective safety and health program can save $4 to $6 for every $1 invested. It's the right thing to do, and doing it right pays off in lower costs, increased productivity, and higher employee morale." (Source: OSHA)
